## About Me

I'm currently a Research Engineer at [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/en) in Paris. As such, I work on R&D projects aiming at processing electromagnetic sensors data. I'm a permanent member of the advanced signal processing unit.

Before that I was a Data Scientist working on computational pathology at [Aignostics](https://www.aignostics.com/) in Berlin. As such, I mostly developed machine learning models and pipelines to run segmentation and classification on whole slide images depicting human tissue with immune cells and cancer.

Before that I was a PhD student in machine learning at [Mines Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mines_ParisTech) (part of [PSL University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Sciences_et_Lettres_University)) and [Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_Group). This research was financed by a [*Cifre-Défense* grant](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/aid/theses/appels-projets/theses-aid-cifre-defense-2025).

## Research Interest

My current work applies machine learning to images, signals, and time series associated with electromagnetic sensors.

I'm interested in anomaly detection, also called out-of-distribution detection or one-class classification, and representation learning for signal, time series and image processing. I'm also interested in classical statistical signal processing.
